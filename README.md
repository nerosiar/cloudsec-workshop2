## Cloud Computing Definition

* Cloud computing is internet-based computing in which large groups of remote servers are networked to allow the centralized data storage, and online access to computer services or resources. Clouds can be classified as public, private , community or hybrid.
* Cloud Computing is a general term used to describe a new class of network based computing that takes place over the internet,
>CLoud Computing consists of hardware and software resources made available on the internet as they are managed by the third party services. These services typically provides access to advanced software applications, high end networks of server computers.

## What is the Benefits offered By The cloud Computing?


<div class="dark-bg">
  <ul>
    <li>On-demand self-service</li>
    <li>Broad Network Access</li>
    <li>Rapid Elasticity</li>
    <li>Measured Service</li>
    <li>Lower Costs</li>
    <li>Reliability</li>
  </ul>
</div>

----

## On-demand Self-Service

* Clients can provision computer resources without the need for interaction with cloud service provider personnel.


----

## Broad Network Access

* Network is the key of the sharing compute.
Access to resources in the cloud is available over the network using standard methods in a manner that provides platform-independent access to clients of all types.

----

## Rapid Elasticity

The system can add resources by either scaling up systems (more powerful computers) or scaling out systems (more computers of the same kind), and scaling may be automatic or manual.
----

## Measured Service

The use of cloud system resources is measured, audited and reported to the customer based on a metered system. A client be charged based on a known metric such as amount of storage used, number of transactions, network input/output, amount of processing power used and so forth .
----

## Lower Costs 

Because cloud networks operate at higher effeciencies and with greater utilization, significant cost reductions are often encountered .
----

## Reliability

The scale of cloud computing networks and their ability to provide load balancing and failover makes them highly reliable, often much more reliable that what you can achieve in a single or organization. 

----

##Â Other Benefits ...

<div class="dark-bg">
  <ul>
    <li>Resource Pooling</li>
    <li>Ease of utilization</li>
    <li>Outsources IT management</li>
    <li>Simplified maintenance and upgrade</li>
    <li>Low barrier to entry</li>
  </ul>

#Â Part 3 : Cloud Security

---

## Key Security Considerations in The Cloud 

----

# Network Security 

<div class="dark-bg">
  <ul>
    <li>Built-in firewalls, control of network access to instances and subnets </li>
    <li>Private / dedicated Connectivity options from office / on-premises envirenments</li>
    <li>Encription in transit</li>
    <li>DDoS mitigation</li>
  </ul>
</div>

----

# Configuration Management 

<div class="dark-bg">
  <ul>
    <li>Inventory and configuration Management Tools to identify resources, track to manage them </li>
    <li>Template definition and management tools to create standard / pre-configure VMs</li>
    <li>Deployment Tools to manage creation and decommissioning of resources as per org.standard</li>
  </ul>
</div>

----

#Â Data Encryption 

<div class="dark-bg">
  <ul>
    <li>Available for data at rest in storage services</li>
    <li>Flexible Key Management options, including Cloud Managed keys / self-managed keys</li>
    <li>Hardware based cryptographic key storage options</li>
    <li>APIs for you to integrate encryption and data protection with any service developed / deployed on the cloud </li>
  </ul>
</div>

----

<div class="dark-bg">
  <ul>
    <li>Deep visibility into API calls, including Who? What? When? Form where? </li>
    <li>Log aggregation, steamlining investigations, compliance reporting </li>
    <li> Alert notifications</li>
  </ul>
</div>

#Â The Road Ahead 

* Clouds are more prone to security attacks than on-perm deployments
* Doesn't mean that those attacks are succeful
* Cloud Providers are better enabled to handle security now 
* 2016 had been the first year when people choose cloud because of security benefits, and not elasticity / cost
* However, stay cautious ! More serious attacks could be expected as well !
---

#Â Conclusion 

---

* Cloud Computing has quickly become one of the most prominent busswords in the IT world due to it's revolutionary model of computing as a utility. It promises increased flexibility, scalability, and reliability, while promising decreased operational and support costs.
* Despite the potential gains achieved from the cloud computing, the organizations are slow in accepting it due to security issues and challenges associated with it. Security is one of the major issues which hamper the growth of cloud. The idea of handling over important data to another company is worrisome; such that the consumers need to be vigilant in understanding the risks of data breaches in this new envirenment.
