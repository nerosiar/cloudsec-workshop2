----

## Broad Network Access

* Network is the key of the sharing compute.
Access to resources in the cloud is available over the network using standard methods in a manner that provides platform-independent access to clients of all types.

----

## Rapid Elasticity

The system can add resources by either scaling up systems (more powerful computers) or scaling out systems (more computers of the same kind), and scaling may be automatic or manual.
----

## Measured Service

The use of cloud system resources is measured, audited and reported to the customer based on a metered system. A client be charged based on a known metric such as amount of storage used, number of transactions, network input/output, amount of processing power used and so forth .
----

## Lower Costs 

Because cloud networks operate at higher effeciencies and with greater utilization, significant cost reductions are often encountered .

#Â Part 2 : Cloud Service Models

---

#Â What is Cloud Service Model

* Deployment Models
* Service Models 

----

# Deployment Models 

* A cloud deployment model represents a specific type of cloud environment, primarly distinguished by ownership, size, and access.
* There are four common cloud deployment models :

----

<img class="slide-img" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nerosiar/cloudsec-workshop2/master/img/Cloud-Deployment-Models.png" />

----

#Â Public Cloud 

* Public Cloud : Public Cloud are owned and operated by a third party cloud service provider, which deliver their computing resources like servers and storage over the internet. As the name suggests, Public cloud is open to public.

----

# Private Cloud :

* The private cloud, in contrast to its public counterpart, isn't available to the public but is built specifically for a single organization to fit its needs. It may be managed internally or by a third-party and be hosted internally or externally.

----

#Â Hybrid Cloud :

* A hybrid cloud is a combination of a private cloud combined with the use of public cloud services allowing data and applications to move between private and public clouds. This model gives business greater flexibility and more deployment options.

----

# Community Cloud 
* Community clouds are a hybrid from of private clouds built and operated specifically for a targeted group. These communities have similar cloud requirements and their ultimate goal is to work together to achieve their business objectives.
> Community clouds are often designed for businesses and organizations working on joint projects, applications, or research, which requires a central cloud computing facility for building, managing and executing such projects, regardless of the solution rented.

---

# Service Models 

In the world of cloud computing, there are three different approaches to cloud-based services :

* Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
* Platform as a Service (PaaS)
* Software as a Service (SaaS)

---

# IaaS : Defs

Iaas is a cloud computing offering in which a vendor provides users access to computing resources such as servers, storage, and networking. Organizations use their own platforms and applications within a service provider's infrastructure.

----

## IaaS : Key Features

* Instead of purchasing hardware outright, users pay for IaaS on demand.
* Infrastructure is scalable depending on processing and storage needs.
* Saves enterprises the costs of buying and maintaining their own hardware.
* Because data is on the cloud, there is no single point of failure.

---

# PaaS : Defs 

PaaS is a cloud computing offering that provides users a cloud envirenment in which they can develop, manage, and deliver applications. In addition to storage and other computing resources, users are able to use a suite of prebuilt tools to develop, customize and test their own applications.

----

## Paas : Key Features 

* PaaS provides a platform with tools to test, develop, and host applications in the same envirenment.
* Enables organizations to focus on development without having to worry about underlying infrastructure.
* Providers manage security, operating systems, server software, and backups.
* Facilitates collaborative work even if teams work remotely.

---

#Â SaaS : Defs 

SaaS is a cloud computing offering that provides users with access to a vendor's cloud-based software. Users do not install applications on their local devices. Instead, the applications reside on a remote cloud network accessed through the web or an API. Through the application, users can store and analyze data and collaborate on projects.

----

##Â SaaS : Key Features 

* SaaS vendors provide users with software and applications on a subscription model.
* Users do not have to manage, install, or upgrade software; SaaS providers manage this.
* Data is secure in the cloud; equipment failure does not result in loss of data.
* Use of resources can be scaled depending on service needs.

---

#Â Pros & Cons 

----

##Â Pros :

* Reduced hardware equipment for end-users
* Improved performance
* Lower H/W and S/W maintenance
* Instant software updates
* Accessibility Metered Services 
* Less Expensive
* Improved Disaster Recovery

----

##Â Cons

* Requires good internet speed with good bandwidth
* Security
* Limited control on infrastructure

#Â Important Point To Know 

----

Top cyberattack methods aimed at cloud deployments grew 45 per cent (Application Attacks), 36 per cent (Suspecious Activity) and 27 per cent (Brute Force Attacks) respectively over the previous year, while top attacks aimed at on-premises deployments remained relatively flat.

----

##Â As per 2014 KPMG Cloud Security Report

* When it comes to selecting a cloud solution, Security is the no. 1 concern
* Compared to 2012 survey, security and data privacy are greater concerns than cost effeciency
* security ois a lesser challenge now , coompared to 2012. Cloud providers better prepared to secure data, and manage security breaches when they occur

# What's the Security for the Cloud

----

### In Some Ways, "Cloud Computing Security"
Is No Different Than "Regular Security"

----

## Define Cloud Security :

Cloud Security is security principles applied to protect data, applications and infrastructure assiciated within the Cloud Computing technology.

----

## Describe Cloud Security

Cloud computing security or, more simply, cloud security is an evolving sub-domain of computer security, network security, and more broadly, information security. It refers to a broad set of policies, technologies, and controls deployed to protect data, applications, and the assiciated infrastructure of cloud computing.
