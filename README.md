## Cloud Computing Definition

* Cloud computing is internet-based computing in which large groups of remote servers are networked to allow the centralized data storage, and online access to computer services or resources. Clouds can be classified as public, private , community or hybrid.
* Cloud Computing is a general term used to describe a new class of network based computing that takes place over the internet,
>CLoud Computing consists of hardware and software resources made available on the internet as they are managed by the third party services. These services typically provides access to advanced software applications, high end networks of server computers.

## What is the Benefits offered By The cloud Computing?


<div class="dark-bg">
  <ul>
    <li>On-demand self-service</li>
    <li>Broad Network Access</li>
    <li>Rapid Elasticity</li>
    <li>Measured Service</li>
    <li>Lower Costs</li>
    <li>Reliability</li>
  </ul>
</div>

----

## On-demand Self-Service

* Clients can provision computer resources without the need for interaction with cloud service provider personnel.


----

## Broad Network Access

* Network is the key of the sharing compute.
Access to resources in the cloud is available over the network using standard methods in a manner that provides platform-independent access to clients of all types.

----

## Rapid Elasticity

The system can add resources by either scaling up systems (more powerful computers) or scaling out systems (more computers of the same kind), and scaling may be automatic or manual.
----

## Measured Service

The use of cloud system resources is measured, audited and reported to the customer based on a metered system. A client be charged based on a known metric such as amount of storage used, number of transactions, network input/output, amount of processing power used and so forth .
----

## Lower Costs 

Because cloud networks operate at higher effeciencies and with greater utilization, significant cost reductions are often encountered .
----

## Reliability

The scale of cloud computing networks and their ability to provide load balancing and failover makes them highly reliable, often much more reliable that what you can achieve in a single or organization. 

----

##Â Other Benefits ...

<div class="dark-bg">
  <ul>
    <li>Resource Pooling</li>
    <li>Ease of utilization</li>
    <li>Outsources IT management</li>
    <li>Simplified maintenance and upgrade</li>
    <li>Low barrier to entry</li>
  </ul>
